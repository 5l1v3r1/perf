## HTML report
In addition to the default tab-separated output, PERF can also generate a fully interactive HTML report for easy downstream analysis of the repeat data. An example HTML report can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RKMlab/perf/html-report/test_data/test_input_perf.html)
